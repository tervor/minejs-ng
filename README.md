Project Halted!
===============

I will no longer update this project!

MineJS-ng
=========
MinejS-ng is a fork from escii/minejs.

Since mineJS is not longer developed, I will develop a new version of this to the actual Minecraft version.

Requirements
------------
* Linux operating system (Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, others should also work but not with install.sh)
* Minecraft server
* Nodejs 0.5 or higher
* Webserver with PHP support

Install
-------
execute install.sh (./install.sh)

Start
-----
just execute ./mine.js  or node mine.js from the minejs directory.
don't forget to add yourself to the ops.txt file if you not already did it.
login to minecraft and run //help
remeber whitelist might be enabled therefore you may need to //whitelist <username> 
further users, before they are able to login.

Thanks to
